# O.K. Hughes' lab notebook

Hello to the unfortunate reader that found their way onto this (probably eventually)
god-forsaken site. I'm a computational atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan
who is most interested in the computational fluid models called Dynamical Cores (Dycores)
that lie at the heart of climate and weather models.

This isn't a particularly useful idea in and of itself, but I could
see a number of future projects that might be able to build on this.

## Urgent todo:
