## Outline of what figures are needed:

How to establish atmospheric river like characteristics? Stereographic projection sales plot?

Evolution:



### 5 days of MSLP in NE60
What does this figure need to do? 
* Establishes that until day 5 it is nonlinear but well behaved (lead in to convergence)
* Showcases evolving wave in relation to topography
* Showcases difference between dry and moist cases (e.g. why does the addition of moisture)

<span class="todo">Possible evolution plot centered on the mountain at e.g. 850hPa</span> 


Moist vs dry comparison (possibly show omega?)


minimum PSL showing convergence and clustering in moist/dry case.


Quantitative comparison of over-mountain evolution at 850hPa (downsampled from highest resolution)


Convergence of eddy kinetic energy etc from the paper

Dynamical core comparison:

Vertically averaged omega for showcasing physics-dynamics coupling strategy

Still unsure of gravity wave propagation. 

FV3 outlier.

To think about: actually topographic differences?

Close reading of precipitation structure & e.g. TPW over the mountain at time of impact! 

(Make these figures! These might help form a story!)
