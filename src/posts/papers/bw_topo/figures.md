### Atmospheric river similarity plot
What does this figure need to do?
* Motivate latitudinal extent and aspect ratio of wave
* Showcase moisture transport properties of wave for use in dynamical core intercomparisons
* Precipitation patterns


## Evolution:



### 5 days of MSLP in NE60
What does this figure need to do? 
* Establishes that until day 5 it is nonlinear but well behaved (lead in to convergence)
* Showcases evolving wave in relation to location of topography



Fields: 
* MSLP
* PRECL
* Precipitable water

Times: 
(day 2?) day 3, day 4, day 5, (day 6)


[Code]()

<span class="todo">Possible evolution plot centered on the mountain at e.g. 850hPa,
this might be valuable to contrast dry with moist! </span> 


### Evolution of precipitation over mountain
Difference between PRECL in nominal 30km grid with second and without. 
* Potential lead-in to close-up comparison of structure over the mountain. 
* Hypothesis: structural characteristics of precipitation at hitting time on hill 

Fields:
* Omega
Time: day 5.


### Moist/dry comparison
* Showcases difference between dry and moist cases (e.g. why does the addition of moisture add something to this case)
* Closeup on `$$\omega $$` over mountain? Think more about this


### minimum PSL showing convergence and clustering in moist/dry case.
* shows that there is clustered agreement at high resolution in moist case, and standard
presumed "convergence" in dry case.

<span class="todo">Check whether these plots look as compelling when you just look at the 
region over the mountain</span>



### Quantitative comparison of over-mountain evolution at 850hPa (downsampled from highest resolution)
What does this show?



### Possible precipitation histogram
* Focus on time of hitting mountain, area directly over mountain.



### eddy kinetic energy plot: convergence






## Dynamical core comparison:

Closeup on evolution of precipitation in nominal 30km case over the mountain

Vertically averaged omega for showcasing physics-dynamics coupling strategy

Still unsure of gravity wave propagation. 

FV3 outlier.
