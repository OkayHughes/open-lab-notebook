## Notes on precipitation histograms:
Interesting paper [https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/18/6/jhm-d-16-0209_1.xml](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/18/6/jhm-d-16-0209_1.xml)

Useful term: "Hydrograph"

Paper that uses gridpoint histograms to evaluate accuracy of prediction
at (I think) nominal 50km spacing [https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/16/22/1520-0442_2003_016_3841_tsooas_2.0.co_2.xml](Temporalâ€“Spatial Scales of Observed and Simulated Precipitation in Central U.S. Climate)

- Todo: check whether validation paper references contain anything fruitful
