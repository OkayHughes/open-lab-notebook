Suppose we have `$$X(t) = \Re(Z(t))$$` and we assume that `$$Z(t)$$` is holomorphic on the upper half plane.
It seems the most profound way to approach this is to examine the tempered distribution `$$ \operatorname{p.v.} \frac{1}{\pi t}$$`. 
What is the representation of this operator in Fourier space, and why is it tempered?
