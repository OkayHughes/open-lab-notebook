There are two regimes in which (linear) Partial Differential Equations have a well-posed notion of causality.
Writing this was inspired by [this provocative argument](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DNv4csBkEW5Pe_JwJ5VcpvTlFGHeP4M/view?usp=sharing),
though I make little effort to directly link what I'm writing about to the argument in that paper.

## Hyperbolic equations
Hyperbolic Initial Value Problems (which could be nonlinear so long as they have benign characteristics)
have a notion of *temporal* causality. That is, the method of characteristics defines which initial values
could potentially affect a down-stream value. Notably, the formation of shocks (see [this useful note](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ol_ODDSdGbXWDY5ilhkleEfJn1aKjZu/view?usp=sharing), [original link:](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~karni/m671/Toro65.pdf))
causes problems for this, and the natural recourse to weak solutions 
leads us to view strong solutions as non-unique. The aforementioned reference
identifies a method by which we can use domain knowledge (such as entropy) not present in the original equations
to impute physically realistic strong solutions. This sort of imputation is key to, e.g., the scientific justification for
Riemann solvers. I suspect (though haven't formalized) that regression to entropy etc. is equivalent to the
implicit diffusion that manifests in Finite Volume schemes. 

## Elliptic equations
Elliptic boundary value problems induce (spatially non-local) causality between boundary values and 
values on the interior. In this case the direction of causality can be transposed at will,
indicating that this intuitive notion of "causality" does not map as cleanly onto the 
squishy notion of causality that we use to design experiments. 


## Parabolic Nonsense:
The ill-posedness of the [backward heat equation](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/pdectb/backward2.pdf)
is a prolific example of just how much information must be imputed in order to 
make any sense of parabolic inverse problems. The infinite propagation speed of
parabolic operators renders hinders us in constructing any notion of "local cause".


## Implications for the atmosphere:
The (continuum) model equations in atmospheric general circulation models are universally taken 
to be the compressible Euler equations. These are notably hyperbolic, but very capable of 
forming shocks (and, as is now known, will blow up as well). Especially
