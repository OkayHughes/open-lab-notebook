There are two regimes in which (linear) Partial Differential Equations have a well-posed notion of causality.
Hyperbolic Initial Value Problems (which could be nonlinear so long as they have benign characteristics)
have a notion of *temporal* causality. That is, the method of characteristics defines which initial values
could potentially affect
