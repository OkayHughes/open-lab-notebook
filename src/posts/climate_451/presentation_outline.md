Outline of slides for 451 final presentation:

Main takeaway message: The linearized equation sets that I initially set out to use
are not well suited to studying the impact of sharpness of topography.

One slide:
* Recap assumptions of linearization  Slide 8 lecture 14
  Takeaway: Constant N^2. N^2/u^2 is key parameter. Where do boundary conditions come from?
* The dispersion relation: Slide 9: Key parameter. 
  * Takeaway: Under highly idealized conditions this gives a simple solution (but how does this generalize?)


* Coming at this from a different angle: long's model
  * maximum 4 equation derivation.
  * Introduce stream function. 
  * Assumptions
Optional: *  Long's notes on existence and uniqueness
  * Main takeaway: tbd
  * The first pin: come back to this.

* Re-deriving what we already know: 
  * Without linearizing at the start, assume \partial_z u = 0, N constant.
  * We get the same dispersion relation.
* Boundary conditions:
  * A quick jaunt through fourier transformations (with a dispersion relation)
  * Gives us solution for gravity wave in the absence of wind shear. Very solvable.
* A brief deviation into energy transport and topography in the steady state
  * Weirstrauss mountain. low-pass filtered weirstrauss mountain
  * Mountain with extremely steep gradients
  * Enforcing a non-linear boundary condition (impacts).
  * Low-pass filter the topography
* Returning to the complex equations: Keller's solution
  * Suppose that we have linear wind shear. 
  * Derive new equations with Z variable.
  * Scale analysis for complicated scorer parameter
* non-hydrostatic version
  * nonhydrostatic Solutions for different topography
  * Energy transport using same topography.
  * Vertical and horizontal structure.
  * low-pass filtered weirstrauss mountain
  * Potentially indicates decreased dependence on topographic steepness? Promising?

* Conclusions:
  * Impact of wind shear on energy transport.
  * Implications for test case design (compare to DCMIP 2012)
