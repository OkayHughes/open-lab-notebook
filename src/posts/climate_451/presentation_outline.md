Outline of slides for 451 final presentation:

Main takeaway message: The linearized equation sets that I initially set out to use
are not well suited to studying the impact of sharpness of topography.


* Recap assumptions of linearization  Slide 8 lecture 14
  Takeaway: Constant N^2. N^2/u^2 is key parameter. Where do boundary conditions come from?
* The dispersion relation: Slide 9: Key parameter. 
  * Takeaway: Under highly idealized conditions this gives a simple solution (but how does this generalize?)

* Coming at this from a different angle: long's model
  * maximum 4 equation derivation.
  * Introduce stream function. 
* Long's notes on existence and uniqueness
  * Main takeaway: tbd
