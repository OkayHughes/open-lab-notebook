## Purpose

In this project I will examine the (mildly nonlinear) behaviour of flows over complex topography. 
Special attention will be paid to the behaviour as steepness of topography increases to infinity.


## Mathematical prerequisites

We start with the equation from [Long 1953](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1953.tb01035.x)
for stratified flow over a mountain in the absence of friction, described by a streamfunction `$$ \Psi $$`

`$$$ \nabla^2 \Psi  + \frac{1}{e} \partial_z e\left[ \partial_z \Psi  - \frac{1}{2}\left\|\nabla \Psi \right)^2\right] $$$`
