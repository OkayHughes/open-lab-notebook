This is going to be part lab notebook, part diary entry. I'm not going to be putting my actual writing here,
but it will contain many of my thoughts and (perhaps) outlines.

### 09/02/2021: staring the beast in the face
At the moment I'm kind of terrified of the only thing in academia that I'm always terrified of:
finally discovering that I'm actually not as good as I think I am and I'm a fraud.
Doing this application will firstly and foremostly be an exercise in combatting that urge.
