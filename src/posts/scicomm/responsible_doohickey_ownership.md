If I use a mathematical/statistical doohickey, one of two conditions must hold.
1) I have worked through implementing and benchmarking the method myself if is simple enough, or
2) there is a body of literature benchmarking and studying sensitivity to violated assumptions, and I am reasonably fluent in this literature.

Ideally, both of these conditions are satisfied.
