Pseudocode:
Have master processor compute block decomposition.
Calculate block decomposition on local processor.
Allocate blocks + ghost cells 

Main loop:
  Communicate ghost cell values
  Calculate updated values
  
  
  
## First task: divide the domain
We want to be able to divide an `$$m\times n$$` matrix among
`$$p$$` processors, with minimal assumptions about divisibility.

Add outer calling routine which takes arbitrary `$$m', n'$$` and 
design inner method assuming `$$ m \geq n$$`


Divide horizontal stripes of matrix among processors.
