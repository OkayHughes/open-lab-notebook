Last time: basic fourier transform theory

Assumes stationarity (related to periodicity).
  * E.g. trend vs annual cycle. In this case we have scale separation in spectral space.

Data in practice are always multiplied by a window function. I.e. you have an observation window.
Therefore, choose a window function which decays in frequency domain as quickly as possible.

Autoregressive process:
  * White noise has no autocorrelation.
  * Random walk: expectation zero, but variance increases.

How to compute power spectrum of random walk?
`$$$
x(t) = ax(t-\Delta t) + (1-a^2)^{1/2}\varepsilon(t), \quad 0 < a < 1
$$$`
which has mean zero and `$$\overline{x^2} = 1 $$`.
Then find autocorrelation `$$r(\Delta t) = \overline{x(t)x(t-\Delta t)} = a $$` using the fact that `$$\varepsilon(t) \bot \varepsilon(t+\Delta t)$$`

Then define `$$T = \frac{-\Delta t}{\log(a)} $$` and we get `$$$r(n\Delta t) = r^n(\Delta t) = a^n = \exp\left(-\frac{n\Delta t}{T}\right) $$$`.
If `$$T=n\Delta t$$` gives `$$r(n\Delta t) = e^{-1}$$` so this is effectively the `$$e$$`-folding time.

Therefore the power spectrum is
`$$$
\Phi(\omega) = \int r(\tau) e^{-i\omega t} \intd{\tau} = \frac{2T}{1+\omega^2T^2}
$$$`
