Last time: basic fourier transform theory

Assumes stationarity (related to periodicity).
  * E.g. trend vs annual cycle. In this case we have scale separation in spectral space.

Data in practice are always multiplied by a window function. I.e. you have an observation window.
Therefore, choose a window function which decays in frequency domain as quickly as possible.

Autoregressive process:
  * White noise has no autocorrelation.
  * Random walk: expectation zero, but variance increases.

How to compute power spectrum of random walk?
`$$$
x(t) = ax(t-\Delta t) + (1-a^2)^{1/2}\varepsilon(t), \quad 0 < a < 1
$$$`
which has mean zero and `$$\overline{x^2} = 1 $$`.
Then note
