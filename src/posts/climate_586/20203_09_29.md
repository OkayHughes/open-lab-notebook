## advanced spectral estimate techniques:
What to do when your process is nonstationary?

Climate science: 
* good data coverage has only existed since the '70s. Quite short relative to climatological time scales
* Quasi-periodicity 
* externally forced cycle
  * e.g. seasonal cycle is HUGE peak, and small leakage can obliterate fidelity of nearby frequencies
* Trends (potentially nonlinear) are not periodic

## Multiple taper method:
* What can you play with if the data length is short?
  * Taper function is main lever we can pull

Suppose `$$a_t$$` such that `$$a^2$$` are a partition of unity.

`$$A(f)$$` is the sum of fourier transforms of each taper. Suppose we wanna ecrease spectral leakage outtside of a 
bandwith `$$2W$$`, me want to maximize
`$$$
\lambda(N, W) = \frac{\int_{-W}^W |A(f)|^2 \intd{f}}{\int_{0.5}^{0.5} |A(f)|^2 \intd{f}}
$$$`
and inverting the transform,
`$$$
\lambda(N, W) = \frac{a_tC_{tt'}a_{t'}}{a_t\cdot a_{t'}}, \qquad C_{tt'} = \frac{\sin[2\pi W(t-T')]}{\pi (t-t')}
$$$`
gives eigenspectrum problem
`$$$
C a_t - \lambda(N, W) a_t = 0
$$$`

Adaptive leakage resistance estimate


* useful for quasi-periodicity
