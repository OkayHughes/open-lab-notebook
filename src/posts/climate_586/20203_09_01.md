## Review of probability and statistics?

Recommendation for online resources: wolfram mathworld, of course.
As usual, for an event `$$ E $$` in a sigma algebra over a sample space `$$ S $$`

* `$$0 \leq \probp(E) \leq 1 $$`
* `$$ \probp(S) = 1$$`
* `$$ \probp(E_1 \cup E_2) = \probp(E_1) + \probp(E_2) $$` if `$$E_1, E_2 $$` mutually exclusive. 

## Monty hall problem:
Let `$$S = \{0, 1, 2\}\times \{\}$$`. Assume we pick random door. Prize is behind door 0.
Strategy 1: `$$ X = \{0\},$$` then obviously `$$ \probp(X) = \frac{1}{3}.$$` Formalize later.

## Random variables.

* PDF: `$$p(x) \geq 0$$` for `$$ x \in S$$` (if it exists!).
* CDF: `$$F(x) \equiv \probp(X < x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} p(x') \intd{x'} $$`

Therefore if we define these this way, `$$p(x) = \der{}{x}F(x) $$` and 
`$$$ \probp(a \leq X \leq b) = F(b)-F(a).$$$`

General properties of `$$F(x)$$`:
* monotonic non-decreasing, 
* `$$ 0 \leq F(x) \leq 1$$`.

Example:
* Uniform distribution `$$\mathcal{U}_{[-1, 1]}$$`
* `$$p_{\mathcal{U}}(x) = \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{1}_{[-1, 1]}(x)$$`
* `$$F_{\mathcal{U}}(x) = \int_{-1}^x p_{\mathcal{U}}\intd{x'} = \frac{1}{2}(\max(\min(x, 1), -1)+ 1) $$`

## Sampling in a computer:
Uniform distribution is quite easy to generate in a computer. Suppose
