## Conclusion: dead end


# 501(C)(3) status

The goal: find the state-issued 501-C(3) status and 
see if there's a way to FOIA the registering documents.

Note: they list their donation address as `1224 Sequoia Place, Davis, CA  95616`

## Use google to search their site for info

* Use google search query `site:amathr.org 501(c)(3)`
Result: this text is in the footer so it just 
returns every page on the site. Dead end
* Use google search query `site:amathr.org 1224 Sequoia Place, Davis, CA  95616`
Only shows up in their donate page.

## Search google more generally

Use the google search query `"1224 Sequoia Place, Davis, CA  95616"` (quotes important)
turns up the [following site:](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ca/C4724700)

This links to the [following registry page!!!](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchType=NUMBER&SearchCriteria=C4724700)

The language for incorporation includes a ban on "Propaganda" and other
political actions, however it appears that this is fairly specific to electoral
politics etc. [c.f.](https://forpurposelaw.com/501c3-political-ban-history/)


There are documents illustrating nothing aside from what we already know. Presumably Prof. Barany
and others found these fairly quickly. Is there PDF
metadata?
