## Conclusion: dead end


# 501(C)(3) status

The goal: find the state-issued 501-C(3) status and 
see if there's a way to FOIA the registering documents.

Note: they list their donation address as `1224 Sequoia Place, Davis, CA  95616`

## Idea: Use google to search their site for info

Use google search query `site:amathr.org 501(c)(3)`
