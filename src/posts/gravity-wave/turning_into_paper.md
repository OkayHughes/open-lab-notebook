## What do I need for a story:
* Relevance to actual modeling.
* Method of addressing problem.
* Actual cause of problem

## Relevance to modeling:
  * Complex topography with 
    * isothermal no flow
    * isothermal SBR

Todo:
  * Read in topography from netcdf file
  * Learn how to use 

## Dependence on topography
  * flat BW vs bw-topo test.

## Anelastic projection?

Todo:
* Get HOMME model running again 
*
