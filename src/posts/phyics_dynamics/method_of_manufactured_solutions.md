[Inspiration](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fld.660)

Idea:
* Take continuum function space (space + time). Ensure obeys boundary conditions (maybe hard?).
* Posit equations of motion (maybe plus hyperviscosity?).
* Posit several solution fields from continuum function space.
* Derive forcing terms necessary to make that solution a steady state. 
* Give dynamics interface to 


Possibilities: take high res atmosphere runs with diabatic forcing, project into high-res space-time basis (e.g. 5 days of high-res amip run). Realistic-ish atmosphere with
