Exploring the two-mountain gravity wave.
=================================================================
 
 
 This is a master post for the experiments that I am running to explore the gravity-wave 
 generated by the topography-induced baroclinic wave test case which Christiane and I are developing.
 
 Said gravity wave develops in all tested dynamical cores to date, but in all but the Spectral Element dycore (CAM version)
 it is quickly damped out.
