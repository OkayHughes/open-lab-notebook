The idea is to look and see if the Staniforth & White generalized thermal wind solutions
can be generalized further if we place less of a premium on closed-form solutions.

The compatibility condition is, letting `$$U 2\Omega u + \frac{u^2}{r\cos\phi} $$`
`$$$ \left(\sin(\phi) \pder{}{r} + \frac{\cos\phi}{r} \pder{}{\phi}\right)\left(\frac{U}{T}\right) $$$`
