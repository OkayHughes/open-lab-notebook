# Notes on "The Mixed-Phase arctic cloud experiment"

* Arctic model scatter larger than other regions (ca 2007)
* "weak solar heating coupled with strong inversions and a combination of sea ice and ocean at the lower boundary produce clouds iwth multiple layersd and stable temp profiles"
* Why doesnt WBF cause rapid dissipation? Clouds long lived"
* Arm mpace: 27 sept 2004 to 22 oct 2004
* North slope of AK DOE installation
* Both ground based and radiosondes (twice daily) taken
* Three weather modes observed
* Several exemplary cases: 
  * 9-11 oct boundary layer stratocumulus
  * cirrus on 17 october
  * Multi-layer stratus on 6 oct
* radar reflectivity plot

# Notes on Intercomparison of Model Simulations of mixed-phase clouds observed during the ARM MPACE experiment. I: single layer cloud
* Little dependence on temperature for liquid vs ice in arctic clouds
* Mixed phase clouds optically thicker than glaciated clouds.
* Modeling studies: mixed phase clouds sensitive to ice crystal number concentration
* Ice formation mechanisms in these clouds is actually unresolved (frindlind 2007)
* Both single-column models and cloud resolving models
* Synoptic conditions: north-easterly flow around an anticyclone.
* Surface heat/WV fluxes from ocean induce boundary layer clouds. (rolls/cloud streets)
  * Fig 1: aerial picture of clouds
