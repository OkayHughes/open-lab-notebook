Final concentration: Correcting LWP and IWP biases for Arctic mixed-phase clouds in CAM5



Physics surrounding longevity of AMPCs
* Mixed phase clouds at warm temperatures (which??) are microphysically unstable. [RESILIENCE]
  * WBF can glaciate in hours
  * But observations of mixed phase clouds show they can persist for days or weeks.
  * Arctic MPCs different (HOW?)
* Turbulence and cloud-scale upward air motion seem to be critical in maintaining mixed-phase clouds under weak synoptic-scale updrafts [RESILIENCE]
* coupling
* Several mechanisms for replenishing
* Sources of uncertainty: synoptic

Highly complex. How do we benchmark?
ARM MPACE:
* Frequently occurring
* Take measurements of, what exactly?
  * Notes on what is high reliability (LIDAR, RADAR)
  * Note on post processing
  * Ice number concentration: suspect

Modelling is difficult: 
* All models (at the time) tended to have similar underrepresentation.
  * Model complexity improves potential to represent clouds, but doesn't guarantee good performance.
* CAM5: how does it treat?
  * Double moment scheme. Four quantities (water, ice, rain, snow)
  * The two WBFs
  * Three-mode aerosol scheme: what gets treated as IN.
  * Implict homogeneity
  

  
  
  
  
Lonely science: can it be studied in isolation?
