These are preliminary notes explaining the difference between what I'm terming "specific-mass coordinates"
and "bulk-mass coordinates". 

The typical hybrid mass coordinate is defined by 
`$$\partial_{\eta} p_h \equiv \partial_{\eta} F_{m} = p_s\partial_{\eta} [A] + p_0 \partial_{\eta} [B] $$` 
where I am going to use `$$F_{m} $$` to refer to a fictitious force that in previous HOMME versions
was called "hydrostatic pressure". 

The well-posedness of this coordinate results from the fact that `$$\int_{\textrm{bot}}^{\textrm{top}} g \hat{m} \intd{z} $$`
