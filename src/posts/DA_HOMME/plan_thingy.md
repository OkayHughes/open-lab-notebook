Current plan for Deep Atmosphere HOMME:

* By next week:
  * Verify derivation in MT overleaf document myself (Use python notebook with toy coefficients/profiles to _ensure_ that there aren't typos)
  * Verify lines in `prim_advance_mod.F90` which correspond to each of these.
  * Optional: Identify lines in `EOS.f90` which need to be modified, and list of variables that might accidentally assume EOS elsewhere in code
  * No actual modifications
* Probably can be done by next month?
