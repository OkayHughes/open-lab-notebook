* At the time of writing, tropical cyclone researchers were examining the so-called beta effect (latitudinal variation in Coriolis force matters)
* Definition: `$$ e_w $$` is zonal NCT, `$$ w_e$$` is vertical NCT

## what experiments were run
* The experiment:
  * 25km grid spacing with two-way nest at 8km grid spacing
  * 20ÂºN
  * Pre-specified vortex in quiescent atmosphere
  ECMWF relative humidity was increased per-level.

* `$$f$$` plane with/without `$$e_w$$`
* `$$\beta$$` plane with/without `$$ e_w$$` 
* 72 hour integration
* Results:
  * Control run shows 72 hour average of `$$w$$` shows magnitudes of 0.5 m/s, resulting in a time-averaged `$$e_w$$` 
  that is almost 50% of the magnitude of the total acceleration magnitude.
