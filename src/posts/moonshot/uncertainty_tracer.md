## Motivation:
* Suppose that we have dry adiabatic reasonably linear  motion evolving over a region of Oklahoma,
a tracer that tracks modeling error should treat this as reasonably certain
* e.g. smoothed orography and other idealizations should be a "source" of variance
and this should propagate with finite speed (i.e. approximately hyperbolically with the wind). 


## Notes

* Assume that we have a quantitative estimate of modeling uncertainty from associated 
physics parameterizations.
* Assume that non-local contributions (e.g. diffusion and parabolicity) are negligible
over the whole domain (Possibly better to do this in non-hydrostatic)
* Assume that physics parameterizations have an associated "modeling uncertainty"
which 
* Tractability assumption: all sources of uncertainty are the same?




* This is probably most useful for short-term forecasts?
