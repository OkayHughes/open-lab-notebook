  key: Native SVD for SE?

## Motivation/question
Does interpretation of native SE point values as coefficients of polynomials
lend itself to a spatially aware SVD? Can it be derived explicitly?

Something like: calculate SVD and then ensure that reconstructed residual is consistent with DSS operation?
Does this hold in the continuum?
