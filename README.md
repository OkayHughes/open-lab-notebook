The personal semi-public lab notebook for Owen Hughes.
I'm an atmospheric scientist working at the University of Michigan. My interests are
in numerical weather prediction, numerical methods, and (increasingly) trying my best to
tear ML emulators to pieces.

All information here is provided without warranty, and I reserve the right to be unprofessional in ways that don't harm anyone. Anyone who could actually steal anything out of these notes is working on topics that are so closely related to what I'm working on that it would make way more sense for us to collaborate. If something on here is actually interesting to you, please shoot me an email so we can talk about what we could work on together.
